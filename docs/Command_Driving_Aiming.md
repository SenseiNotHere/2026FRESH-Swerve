# Autonomous Driving and Aiming Command Examples
(but you can also bind them to teleop buttons too: in `robotcontainer.py`, inside `configureButtonBindings` function)

## 1. Pre-requisites
Does your robot already have a drivetrain with odometry? (tank or swerve)

If not, why not copy (or fork) of one of these templates (they are public, with WPI license):

* Swerve drivetrain example: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44iMiQXQH5U
* Tank/Arcade drivetrain example: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhYMjLz0ync

## 2. Three must-have commands, for all else to work (even on swerve bots)
**Must have!** These commands have important constants that may need to be adjusted to your robot.

Click on triangle signs below, in order to see the command code:

    <summary>Turning until you find an object using camera</summary>

This code works with Limelight or PhotonVision cameras from [here](Adding_Camera.md) (step-by-step video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b9DZQ8CyII).

The code below should go to `commands/findobject.py` .

```python
import commands2
from commands.aimtodirection import AimToDirection


class FindObject(commands2.Command):

    def __init__(self, camera, drivetrain, turnDegrees=-45, turnSpeed=1.0, waitSeconds=0.1):
        super().__init__()
        self.camera0 = camera
        self.drivetrain = drivetrain
        self.addRequirements(camera)
        self.addRequirements(drivetrain)

        # to find object, we will be running (wait + turn) + (wait + turn) ... in a long cycle, until object is detected
        wait = commands2.WaitCommand(waitSeconds)
        turn = AimToDirection(
            degrees=lambda: self.drivetrain.getHeading().degrees() + turnDegrees,
            drivetrain=self.drivetrain,
            speed=turnSpeed
        )

        self.subcommand = wait.andThen(turn)

    def initialize(self):
        self.subcommand.initialize()

    def isFinished(self) -> bool:
        return self.camera0.hasDetection()

    def execute(self):
        # 1. just execute the wait+turn subcommand
        self.subcommand.execute()

        # 2. and if that command is finished, start it again (we are doing cycles, right?)
        if self.subcommand.isFinished():
            self.subcommand.end(False)
            self.subcommand.initialize()

    def end(self, interrupted: bool):
        self.subcommand.end(interrupted)

## 6. REEFSCAPE special command!
<details>
    <summary>Aligning a swerve robot to an AprilTag in front of it, and then firmly pushing against the tag to score that coral onto reef</summary>

This should go as a function in `robotcontainer.py`, and you can either bind it to a button or make an auto out of it:
```python3
   def makeAlignWithAprilTagCommand(self):
        from commands.setcamerapipeline import SetCameraPipeline
        from commands.followobject import FollowObject, StopWhen
        from commands.alignwithtag import AlignWithTag
        from commands.swervetopoint import SwerveToSide

        # switch to camera pipeline 3, to start looking for certain kind of AprilTags
        lookForTheseTags = SetCameraPipeline(self.camera, 3)
        approachTheTag = FollowObject(self.camera, self.robotDrive, stopWhen=StopWhen(maxSize=4), speed=0.3)  # stop when tag size=4 (4% of the frame pixels)
        alignAndPush = AlignWithTag(self.camera, self.robotDrive, None, speed=0.2, pushForwardSeconds=1.0)

        # connect them together
        alignToScore = lookForTheseTags.andThen(approachTheTag).andThen(alignAndPush)

        # or you can do this, if you want to score the coral 15 centimeters to the right and two centimeters back from the AprilTag
        # stepToSide = SwerveToSide(drivetrain=self.robotDrive, metersToTheLeft=-0.15, metersBackwards=0.02, speed=0.2)
        # alignToScore = lookForTheseTags.andThen(approachTheTag).andThen(alignAndPush).andThen(stepToSide)

        return alignToScore

```

This code works with Limelight or PhotonVision cameras from [here](Adding_Camera.md) (step-by-step video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b9DZQ8CyII).
The code for the command AlignWithTag should go to `commands/alignwithtag.py` .
